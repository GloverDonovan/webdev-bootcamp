The Mozilla Webdev Group
========================

The Mozilla Webdev Group is an informal group of people across the Mozilla
project that are interested in or work in web development. The group isn't
linked to a specific team and welcomes everyone who wants to be a part of
it to join.

As a new contributor, you'll primarily be using the Webdev group to help
answer questions you have or to find interesting projects to work on. Later
on, you can start attending some of our online meetings to meet the rest
of the group and keep up to date with what everyone else is up to.

How to Talk to Us
-----------------

There's two main channels of communication for the group:

- The #webdev channel on `irc.mozilla.org <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_.
- The `dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list
  <https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-webdev>`_.

If you ever have any question, regardless of how difficult it is, you can share
it on those channels and someone should help you out. *Don't be afraid to ask
questions!* You're trying to help us, so it's only fair that we try to help you
in return.

Find a Mentor!
--------------

It's also a good idea to find someone to mentor you as a new contributor.
Having someone you can personally ask for help from is incredibly helpful in
finding your way around.

If you're a new employee, your mentor may be your manager, or it may be a
coworker. If you're a volunteer, ask someone who works on the project you want
to contribute to. If they cannot mentor you themselves, they should be able
to direct you to someone who can.

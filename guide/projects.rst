Finding a Project
=================

Before you can contribute to Mozilla, you need to find a project that you're
interested in contributing to. There are many different projects in Webdev,
both full websites and libraries to help others make websites.

If you don't already have a project in mind, there are a few ways to find
projects to contribute to:

- The `GetInvolved`_ page lists a curated selection of projects as well as
  information on who to get in contact with if you want to help.
- If you email the `dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list`_
  with some information on what your skills are and where your interests lie,
  someone may reply with a recommendation.

.. _`dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list`: https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-webdev

Getting set up
--------------

Once you've identified the project you want to work on, you should set up a
development instance of the site. All projects have (or should have) a README
file that either describes how to set up the site for development, or links
to documentation that does.

Find a mentor
-------------

You may also find it useful to find someone who is working on or responsible
for the project you want to contribute to and asking if they can help you find
a task to work on and answer any other questions you have. If there's no
information in the README for a project about who works on it, you can check
the commit history (available in GitHub by clicking "# commits" near the top
of the page) to find who recently worked on the project, or by asking the
:doc:`Webdev group <webdev>` who is responsible.

How to contribute
-----------------

Once you're set up to work on a project, you'll have to find a task to work on
and get to work! Each project should have some information on where their tasks
are tracked, whether it be in Bugzilla, GitHub issues, or some other system.
If you're having trouble finding this information, try looking:

- For a ``CONTRIBUTNG`` file in the repository. Many projects use this file
  to store instructions on how to start as a contributor.
- For a `contribute.json`_ file, which contains a machine-readable dump of
  links and information on how to start contributing to a project.

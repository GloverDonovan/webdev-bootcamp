Building locally
----------------
The instructions below assume you have Python and `pip`_ installed. It is also
strongly recommended that you create and activate a `virtualenv`_ first.

If you'd like to build the bootcamp locally:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   make html

The resulting docs can be located under the ``_build/html`` directory.

You can also run ``make livehtml`` to launch a web server on
http://127.0.0.1:8000 to rebuild the documentation automatically when any
files are changed.

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/
